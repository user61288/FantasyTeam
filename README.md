# FantasyTeam

## Project Idea
This is a game of chance modeling a fantasy football game. Depending on your team lineup - either the default team assigned, or the team you setup by buying/selling players, your overall score increases or decreases at the end of every game. Adjust your line up as you play and see your score go up the scoreboard!
